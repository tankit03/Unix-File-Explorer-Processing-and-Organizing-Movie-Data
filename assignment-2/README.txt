This is how to compile my code:
1. first join or go onto the OSU servers for Oregon State university.
2. Then navigate into the directory where you have unziped the file.
3. Then type into terminal gcc --std=gnu99 -o movies movies_by_year.c and hit enter.
4. Finally, type ./movies movies_sample_1.csv or any file with the prefix movies_.csv and click enter.
5. then the program should run.
